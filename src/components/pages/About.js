            <p>
                My name is Brad Carlson. I am 22 years young! I live in Kansas where I was born and raised. Playing video games and working out in my free time is what I enjoy to do to pass time. Something interesting about me is that I work at a meat market which is a very different job that I never expected to do but I have learned a lot from.

                Through this class I have learned a lot of skills about coding. From the basics of HTML and CSS all the way to the complex languages of React and all the inbetween. After learing all the ins and outs of coding through this class I am able to work on front end, back end and even both at the same time. I do feel a lot more comfortable working on the back end in my opinion, I feel a lot more comfortable working on that end of a project than the front after my experience going through this class but am still working on the front end work as well to become even better.
